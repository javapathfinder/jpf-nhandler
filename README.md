jpf-nhandler

jpf-nhandler is an extension of Java PathFinder (JPF) that automatically delegates the execution of selected methods from JPF to the host JVM.

When a method call o.m(a) is delegated, jpf-nhandler performs the following steps:

Transforms the JPF representation of the object o and arguments a to their host JVM representations.

Executes the original (native or non-native) method m on the host JVM.

Transforms the result back into its JPF representation.

The implementation mainly relies on MJI (Model Java Interface) and generates native peers on-the-fly using the BCEL library. These generated peers are referred to as on-the-fly (OTF) peers.

Requirements

Java 11 (recommended)

Java 8 may still work, but Java 11 is the primary supported version.

Git

Gradle (via the included Gradle wrapper)

jpf-core installed and built

To check your Java version:

java -version

src/main/java contains the core implementation of jpf-nhandler.

src/test/java contains unit tests.

onthefly/ contains generated native peer sources and bytecode when source generation is enabled.

Installing jpf-nhandler
1. Install jpf-core

Follow the instructions on the jpf-core wiki.
It is recommended to clone the master branch and build it using the Gradle wrapper.

Note: Some jpf-core tests may fail. This does not prevent using JPF.

2. Clone jpf-nhandler
git clone https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-nhandler.git
cd jpf-nhandler

3. Build jpf-nhandler
./gradlew build


A successful build may produce warnings related to internal Java APIs, which are expected.

4. Run Tests
./gradlew test


All tests should pass before using the extension.

5. Register jpf-nhandler

Add jpf-nhandler to your site.properties file as described in the jpf-core documentation.

Running JPF with jpf-nhandler

To run JPF with jpf-nhandler enabled, include the following in your .jpf file:

@using = jpf-nhandler

target = Example

nhandler.delegateUnhandledNative = true

classpath = path-to-application-classes
native_classpath = path-to-application-classes

Important Note on Classpaths

Classes belonging to the System Under Test (SUT) must be accessible to both:

JPF (classpath)

Host JVM (native_classpath)

Since execution alternates between JPF and the host JVM, the same directories or JAR files should be specified for both properties.

Configuration Options

jpf-nhandler provides several configuration options:

Delegating Methods

Delegate a specific constructor:

nhandler.spec.delegate = a.b.C.<init>


Delegate all methods of a class:

nhandler.spec.delegate = java.lang.String.*

Skipping Methods

Skip a specific method (executed as empty, returns a dummy value):

nhandler.spec.skip = java.io.FileDescriptor.write

Delegate Only Unhandled Native Calls
nhandler.delegateUnhandledNative = true

On-the-Fly Native Peers

jpf-nhandler generates native peers dynamically. These peers are stored in:

jpf-nhandler/onthefly/

Generate Source Code for OTF Peers
nhandler.genSource = true

Compile Generated Sources Manually
javac -cp "<JPF_HOME>/build/jpf.jar:<NHANDLER_HOME>/build/jpf-nhandler.jar" onthefly/*.java

Reuse Generated Peers

To reuse generated peers across runs:

nhandler.clean = false

Limitations

Platform-specific classes (e.g., java.lang.System) cannot be handled due to JVM inconsistencies.

Delegated objects and classes must have consistent fields and superclasses in both JPF and the host JVM.

Side effects must be observable only via return values, arguments, or the invoking object.

Objects with native-managed state (e.g., java.awt.Window) cannot be handled.

Licensing

jpf-nhandler is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License v3 (or later).

The licenses of third-party JAR files in lib/example are included with the project.
